    <p class="mt-5 font-inter text-md">
        While all members of Congress possess the same amount of power, some simply exercise that power less than
        others. <span class="font-bold">In order to mitigate political inactivity, Congress Activity monitors the voting behavior of every
        member of the United States Congress. </span>A high absentee rate points to a congress member's lack of political willâ€”
        missed votes are wasted chances to push for what their agendas promised when they were voted into office.
